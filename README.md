# 📍🐄🙅‍♂️ FindDairyFree

An estimated 32 million adults have food allergies in the United States alone, and that number is continually rising ([AAFA](https://aafa.org/allergies/types-of-allergies/food-allergies/)). As such, it is becoming more and more important for individuals to 
find out-of-the-house options where they are comfortable eating, particually making sure they are aware of [cross-contact](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6324195/). 

⭐️ FindDairyFree is a map-based iOS application that is designed to help users locate nearby
restaurants, bakeries, and cafes that are "safe" for someone with a dairy allergy to eat at.

## Features
* 🗺️ An interactive map interface that displays the user's location (if they allow). Note that this app will not work to its full potential if location services are not enabled. 
* 📍 The ability to see all of the locations of restaurants (based on [Go Dairy Free's Database](https://www.godairyfree.org/dining-out/massachusetts-dairy-free-restaurants)) on a map interface. 
* ℹ️ Upon clicking on a particular restaurant on the app, the user can view the following information about it:
  *   The name of the restaurant
  *   Its address
  *   A link to their website (particularly the allergy information page if it is available).
  *   A description of the dairy-free options available, as given by [Go Dairy Free's Database](https://www.godairyfree.org/dining-out/massachusetts-dairy-free-restaurants). 
  *   Any tags the restaurant may have including but not limited to: Lunch/Dinner, Dessert, Vegan, Plant-Based, Cafe, Star, Coffee, Ice Cream, Bakery, Top-9, Japanese, Mexican, Greek, Vietnamese. (The user will also have the ability to create and add their own tags to a restaurant).  
* 📍 The user can add more locations manually if they want more options to display that are not listed already. The user will also have the option to fill out a form suggesting a new restaurant with dairy-free options.
* 🔎 Search for a particular restaurant, bakery, or cafe.
* 🚶 Once they choose a place in which they would like to travel to, they can click on a green "GO" button that will bring them to the Apple Maps app and give them directions to their destination. 
* 💡 Upon opening, the app will display a pop-up to the user: "We found X options for you within Y miles.", where X is the number of restaurants that the app has found for the user, and Y is the specified distance from the user's location to look for restaurants upon starting. This will only happen if there are restaurants within a specified location of the user. If no restaurants are found within Y miles of the user, a new popup will instead say "There's nothing within Y miles of you. Change your radius?" 

## Constraints 
* For the time being, this will only work for the Boston and Cambridge area. 
* More coming soon.
