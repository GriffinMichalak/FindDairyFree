An estimated 32 million adults have food allergies in the United States alone, and that number is continually rising ([AAFA](https://aafa.org/allergies/types-of-allergies/food-allergies/)). As such, it is becoming more and more important for individuals to 
find out-of-the-house options where they are comfortable eating, particually making sure they are aware of [cross-contact](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6324195/). 

FindDairyFree is a map-based iOS application that is designed to help users locate nearby
restaurants, bakeries, and cafes that are "safe" for someone with a dairy allergy to eat at.

## Features
* An interactive map interface that displays the user's location (if they allow). Note that this app will not work to its full potential if location services are not enabled. 
* The ability to see all of the locations of restaurants (based on [Go Dairy Free's Database](https://www.godairyfree.org/dining-out/massachusetts-dairy-free-restaurants)) on a map interface. 
* Upon clicking on a particular restaurant on the app, the user can view the following information about it:
*   dsfdfd
* The user can add more locations manually if they want more options to display that are not listed already. The user will also have the option to fill out a form suggesting a new restaurant with dairy-free options.
* Search for a particular restaurant, bakery, or cafe.
* Once they choose a place in which they would like to travel to, they can click on a green "GO" button that will bring them to the Apple Maps app and give them directions to their destination. 
* Upon opening, the app will display a pop-up to the user: "We found X options for you within Y miles.", where X is the number of restaurants that the app has found for the user, and Y is the specified distance from the user's location to look for restaurants upon starting. This will only happen if there are restaurants within a specified location of the user. If no restaurants are found within Y miles of the user, a new popup will instead say "There's nothing within Y miles of you. Change your radius?" 

## Constraints 
For the time being, this will only work for the Boston and Cambridge area
