# 🐄🙅‍♂️ FindDairyFree

An estimated 32 million adults have food allergies in the United States alone, and that number is continually rising [AAFA](https://aafa.org/allergies/types-of-allergies/food-allergies/). 

FindDairyFree is a mobile iOS application that is designed to help users locate nearby
restaurants, bakeries, and cafes that are safe for someone with a dairy allergy to eat at.
It is a map-based application that shows the user's location (if they allow), and 
identifies safe restaurants near them.
