An estimated 32 million adults have food allergies in the United States alone, and that number is continually rising ([AAFA](https://aafa.org/allergies/types-of-allergies/food-allergies/)). As such, it is becoming more and more important for individuals to 
find out-of-the-house options where they are comfortable eating, particually making sure they are aware of [cross-contact](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6324195/), as well as finding food options that are safe for them. 

‚≠êÔ∏è FindDairyFree is a free, open-source, map-based iOS application that is designed to help users locate nearby
restaurants, bakeries, and cafes that are "safe" for someone with a dairy allergy to eat at.
